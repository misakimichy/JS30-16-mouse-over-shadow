## About this Application:
- Text shadow will follow your mouse move.
- You can change how far the shadow goes. Change the value of `walk` in line 4 of `mina.js`. The bigger the number gets, the farther the shadow goes.

- Multiple shadow effect - comment out the line 22 and uncomment the line 25 - 30 to play around.
